#: c3smembership/templates/manifesto.pt:9
msgid "manifesto-title"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Art is communication. There is no freedom of expression without freedom
#. of art. Communication is learning by doing, ever evolving, reacting on others,
#. re-using the same expressions and re-combining them into new meaning,
#. re-expressing the same meaning in new ways, paraphrasing what was understood.
#. And so is art.
#: c3smembership/templates/manifesto.pt:18
msgid "manifesto-v1-paragraph-1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Art, as an expression of human culture, eventually cannot be restricted
#. or limited, because each restriction and limitation calls to artists to overturn
#. it, each taboo begs to be broken, in a picture, in a song, in a dance, in
#. software code, maybe in silence. The only restrictions and limitations which can
#. prevail are those we agree upon ourselves, through honest and open discourse. In
#. other words, communication.

#. Default: Reflection and inspiration
#: c3smembership/templates/manifesto.pt:24
msgid "manifesto-v1-headline-1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: Art is neither good nor bad in itself, as all evaluation is subject to
#. its time, cultural customs, historic context and individual ethics, to name but
#. a few. It is perhaps not even a piece of work itself, but an event happening
#. inside of each individual that is confronted with it, experiences it, thinks
#. about it or completely rejects it. Art is what it does to us; the reflection and
#. inspiration it invites us to. Reflection and inspiration are neither good nor
#. bad in themselves. They are simply a neccessity to make it through life. And so
#. is art.
